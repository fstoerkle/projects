Meat projects for your meat club to fork, make, and enjoy.

This is the public repo for all meat projects that we've published via the <a href="http://meatclub.in">Meat Club</a> site, the <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/app/meat-club/id967637748">Meat Club iPad app</a>, or the Meat Club Android app (coming soon).

All meat projects in the iPad app also include photos for every project step, as well as a recipe that accompanies or utilizes the meat project (e.g. a gumbo recipe for your homemade Andouille).

Some meat projects are only available from this repo. We may officially publish them at a future date.
