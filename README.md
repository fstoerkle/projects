Meat projects for your meat club to fork, make, and enjoy.

This is the public repo for all meat projects that we've published via the <a href="http://meatclub.in">Meat Club</a> site, or the (coming soon) Meat Club iOS app. All meat projects in the iOS app also include photos for every project step, as well as a recipe that accompanies or utilizes the meat project (e.g. a gumbo recipe for your homemade Andouille). Some meat projects are only available from this repo.
