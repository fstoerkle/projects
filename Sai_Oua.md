# Sai Oua

Sai oua is a sausage from nothern Thailand. You'll see it in the markets and sidewalk carts in large coils on smoking charcoal grills. In restaurants, it's served with a spicy eggplant sauce called nam prik num, and raw veggies to cool things down. In the street it's often sliced, tossed in a plastic bag with some raw white cabbage and spicy chili sauce and a pointy little stick to eat it all with.

The bright green color is from the large amounts of fresh herbs in the recipe, imparting a springy pungent aroma that hides THE FURY OF THE CHILI HIDING WITHIN. Yes, sai oua can be spicy.

## Overall Time

5 hours

## Preparation Time

5 hours

## Equipment

* Meat grinder
* Sausage stuffer
* Large mortar and pestle, or food processor

## Ingredients

* 8 pounds pork shoulder
* 2 pounds pork belly
* 20 shallots, or enough for 5 cups chopped
* 4 heads garlic
* 4 bunches of cilantro, with roots if you can find it
* 2 cups chopped kaffir lime leaves
* 20 stalks of lemongrass
* 4 3-4 inch pieces galangal or ginger
* 30 red Thai chilies
* 10 green Thai chilies
* 1/4 cup kosher salt

### For Casing

* 4 cups water
* 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar
* 20 ft. hog casing

## Directions

### Let's Roll 

Place 3 large mixing bowls and the meat grinder attachment in the freezer for 15 minutes before use. Keeping the equipment cold will help the grinding happen quickly.

Measure out all the ingredients from your shopping list, then get ready to prep them as outlined below.

### Prepare the Casing

At least 30 minutes before using the casing:

Rinse the casing well. Add 4 cups water and 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar to a bowl. Place the casing in the water / vinegar mixture.

### Dice the Pork

If you're grinding your own meat, chop the pork shoulder and pork belly into 1-inch chunks, and place them in the chilled mixing bowls. Place the diced pork in the freezer for at about 10 minutes before grinding.

### Grindhouse

Prepare the meat grinder with the small die. Grind both the diced pork shoulder and pork belly, allowing the ground meat to drop into a chilled mixing bowl. Put the ground meat in the refrigerator for now.

### Veg-o-matic

Get ready, this is a lot of chopping. Divide it up between a couple of people! Make sure to keep each ingredient in separate containers as you go.

Peel and quarter the shallots, finely chop by hand or in the food processor. If using a food processor, only pulse it a few times - over-processing will release too much water, making the sausage wet, and difficult to stuff.

Peel all of the garlic, chop fine by hand or in the food processor.

### Pok, Pok, Pok

Peel off the hard outer layers of the lemongrass, and the reedy tops. Slice into very thin rings, around 1/8 inch wide, and then pound in batches in the mortar and pestle. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, pulse it in a food processor until it's finely chopped.

Clean and peel the galangal, chop into 1-inch pieces, then pound it in batches with the mortar and pestle until it's *completely* smashed. This will take about 5 minutes per batch. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, put it in the food processor for a long time, until it seems like it's not getting any smaller.

### Chop, Chop, Chop

Wash the cilantro if dirty. Chop coarsely, including all roots and stems.

Chop the lime leaves into thin strips and then chop those into quarters.

Remove the stems from the chilies and chop into small slices 1/4 inch wide. Leave the seeds in for the correct amount of heat, unless you're a bloody coward.

### Mashup Time

In a large mixing bowl, mix the ground meat and the vegetable mixture.

If you don't have a bowl large enough, split between a few bowls. Pro tip: A large roasting pan can also help out here.

### Quality Control

Put a pan over heat, make a sausage patty (yeah that's right, you just made sausage!) and cook until done. Taste it, and adjust salt & heat to your liking. Keep in mind that the flavors will take at least a day to gel.

This is a recipe you can play with. You can add more or less of any of the fresh ingredients to your liking. Try making it more or less salty, herby, fatty or spicy.

### Stuff the Casing

Prepare the sausage stuffer for use.

Press meat through the stuffer until the ground meat just barely pokes through the end of the spout.  

Push the open end of the hog casing over the end of the stuffer, and continue to push the casing onto the stuffer until you reach the end of the casing. Tie a knot at the end of the casing.

Stuff the sausage into the hog casings and wrap the sausage into a long coil. Once finished, tie off the other end of the sausage. Twist the sausage into links every 6 inches.

### Pack, Label and Store

Place the cased sausages in butcher paper or sealable plastic freezer bags and use a Sharpie to label the package __Sai Oua: made {{current_date}}__.

Refrigerate for at least 24 hours before eating or freezing, to allow the flavors to mingle. The sausage can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, and frozen for up to three months.

Cook the sausage to an internal temperature of 150°F / 65°C before serving. The Sai Oua is great right off the grill. You can do it on a bun, or go true Thai style and serve sliced alongside some pork rinds and cucumber slices.
