# Salt Beef

Back in the days of the British Empire, Salt Beef was the staple of the British naval fleet’s diet. We’ve come to think of schite dog-food-esque beef that’s been sardined into cans as proper representations of Salt Beef, but you can make it so much better with a little work.

Now, the Brits call this Salt Beef, but we 'mericans have come to know this as Corned Beef. Per the etymology of the verb "to corn", salt is first corned, or crushed into grains of salt. Then the corned salt is added to water to create a brine, within which the brisket is submersed in order to cure and preserve it. Keep it in the brine for 5 days, the braise the brisket for 3 hours, and you’ll nom on some of the most delicious, tender meat you’ll ever try.

## Overall Time

5 days

## Preparation Time

Day 1: 1 hour 30 minutes 

Day 5: 8 hours

## Equipment Checklist

If your stockpot will not fit in the refrigerator, find a suitable non-reactive container for storing the brine and briskets for 5 days.

## Ingredients

* 2 (6 lbs. each) beef briskets
* 2 ¼ cups kosher salt
* 2 tbsp. Instacure No. 1 curing salt
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 8 cloves garlic
* 10 cloves
* 10 allspice berries
* 1 tbsp. black peppercorns
* 1 tbsp. mustard seeds
* 1 tbsp. coriander seeds
* 1 tbsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 4 bay leaves
* 1 2-inch piece ginger
* 5 lbs. crushed ice

## Directions

### Let's Roll

Measure out all of the ingredients from your shopping list, so that they are ready to work with in the subsequent steps.

Before you toss them all together, divide the pickling spices (the ginger, cloves, allspice berries, black peppercorns, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, crushed red pepper flakes and bay leaves) in half, for use both in the brine and in the final simmer. Set aside in a small covered container.

Measure out 1 gallon of water for the brine.

### Prepare the Brine

Peel and halve the garlic and ginger.

Place 1 gallon of water, the kosher salt, curing salt, brown sugar, garlic, and pickling spices in a large stockpot, and turn the heating element to high.

Once the water is brought to a boil, reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Add 5 lbs. ice cubes to the brine in order to quickly bring the liquid down to room temperature.

### Trim the Brisket

Rinse the brisket under cold water.

Trim any excess fat from the beef brisket. We trim our briskets to have just under ½ inch of fat surrounding the muscle tissue. Others prefer a leaner brisket, with about ⅛ inch of fat.  

### Submerse the Brisket

Check the temperature of the brine. Once it is at room temperature, we’re ready to go. Add more ice cubes to bring the temperature down as needed.

If your stockpot will not fit in the refrigerator, ladle the brine into a non-reactive container. Label the container __Corned Beef: Braise on {{current_date+5}}__.

Submerse the briskets in the brine. Refrigerate for 5 days. Check the brine once per day to ensure the brisket is completely submerged in the liquid.

### Rinse 'er Off

5 days after brining the briskets, remove it from the brine. Run warm water over the brisket to remove any brining ingredients that may have stuck to it. Dry the briskets off with paper towels.

### Braise Away

Place the briskets in a large stock pot, and fill with water until both briskets are submerged. Add the remaining pickling ingredients to the water.

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and allow to simmer for about 3 hours, until the brisket is fork-tender.

### Aye!

Using 2 pairs of tongs, pull each brisket out of the stockpot and allow to rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slide the Corned Beef.

Serve as a standalone dish, or use it to make corned beef hash or the best shit-on-a-shingle you'll ever try.

If you have leftovers, place wax paper on a kitchen scale, and stack the Corned Beef on the wax paper until it reads ½ pound (8 oz.), and fold the wax paper over. Place the Corned Beef in butcher paper or sealable freezer storage bags, and label with a Sharpie __Corned Beef: made {{current_date}}__. You can store this safely for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator and up to 2 months in the freezer.
