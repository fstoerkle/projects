## Ingredients

* 2 pork loins
* 4 tbsp. fennel seed
* 4 tbsp. black peppercorns
* 8 star anise
* 4 cinnamon sticks
* 2 heads garlic
* 1 ½ cups kosher salt
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 lemons
* 3 tbsp. Instacure No. 1 curing salt
* 1 gallon water
* 5 lbs. crushed ice

## Directions

### Let's Roll

Measure out all of the ingredients from your shopping list, so that they are ready to work with in the subsequent steps.

Measure out 1 gallon of water for the brine.

### Prepare the Brine

Halve the garlic. Place 1 gallon of water and all of the ingredients (except the pork loins and the ice cubes) in a large stockpot, and turn the heating element to high.

Once the water is brought to a boil, reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Add 5 lbs. ice cubes to the brine in order to quickly bring the liquid down to room temperature.

### Brine it Up

Rinse off the pork loins. Trim any silver skin off the outside of the loins. Cut the loins into pieces roughly 4 inches in length.

Check the temperature of the brine. Once it is at room temperature, we’re ready to go. Add more ice cubes to bring the temperature down as needed.

If your stockpot will not fit in the refrigerator, ladle the brine into a non-reactive container. 

Submerse the loins in the brine. Refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Check the brine later that day to ensure the brisket is completely submerged in the liquid.

### Remove from the Brine

Pour the brine and ingredients into a strainer. Remove the loins and rinse off any brine ingredients that are stuck to the loins. 

Place the loins on a cooling rack over a baking sheet, in order to catch the drippings.

Put the baking sheet in the refrigerator, and let sit uncovered in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours in order to dry.

### Smokin' Loins

Smoke the pork loins at 180°F / 82°C until they reach an internal temperature of 145°F / 63°C. 

The preferred smoking woods for this style of Bacon include wood from fruit trees (apple, cherry, pear, etc.) for a lighter, fruitier smokiness.

When ready, remove from the smoker and place on cooling racks.

### Done, eh!

Place the Canadian Bacon in butcher paper or sealable freezer storage bags, and label with a Sharpie __Canadian Bacon: made {{current_date}}__. Place in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or the freezer for up to 2 months.

You may slice the Canadian Bacon and consume it cold, or use it to make a killer Eggs Benedict.
